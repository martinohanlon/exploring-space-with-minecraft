## Examine the data

The data from the sensors has been written to a [CSV (Comma Seperated Values) file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), which is a common way of storing data. This can be opened using a spreadsheet application, including Libre Office Calc which comes preinstalled on Raspbian Jessie.

Open the file using LibreOffice Calc and have a look at the data:

- Open LibreOffice Calc by clicking `Menu > Office > LibreOffice Calc`
2. Click `File > Open`
3. Select `All Files`
4. Double-click `data.csv`
5. Click `OK` on the Text Import window

The top row is the name of the field, and each row after this is one line of data.

Can you use the spreadsheet to create a line graph of the temperature over time?

You can download the SpaceCRAFT data which was captured on the ISS [here](resources/SpaceCRAFT_20160209_104426.csv). Try loading this into LibreOffice Calc and recreating your graph.
