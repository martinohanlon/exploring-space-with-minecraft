SpaceCRAFT was conceived by Hannah Belshaw of Cumnor Girls School and created by [Martin O'Hanlon](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com) for the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org). 


## What you will learn
By exploring space with Minecraft you will learn:

- All about the Sense HAT and what it can do
- How to look at the data collected by the sensors on the Sense HAT using Minecraft
- How to analyse data from the Sense HAT using a spreadsheet
- How to play back data recorded from the Sense HAT and visualise it in Minecraft

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

+ [Can programmatically read and manipulate a data structure](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder){:target="_blank"}

+ [Can write programs to read data from digital and analogue inputs and to control digital and analogue outputs](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/physical-computing/creator/){:target="_blank"}
