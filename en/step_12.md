## Capturing data from the Sense HAT

While the Sense HATs were on the ISS, Tim Peake ran the SpaceCRAFT data capture program for a week. This created a [file of data](resources/SpaceCRAFT_20160209_104426.csv) from all the Sense HAT's sensors, and this was sent back to Earth, allowing you to see what conditions were like on the ISS.

You can use your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT in the same way to capture data about your environment, whether that's in your home, classroom or anywhere else you can find to set it up.
