## Run the interactive Sense HAT program

Open a terminal by clicking the icon on the taskbar, or by clicking `Menu > Accessories > Terminal`, and enter the following commands one by one, pressing `Enter` after each command:

```
cd ~/SpaceCRAFT/spacecraft
python3 mcinteractiveastropi.py
```

The interactive Sense HAT will be created directly above the player's position. If you go back to Minecraft and look up, you should see the bottom of the Raspberry Pi.
